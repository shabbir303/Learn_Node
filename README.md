## Learn Node
- use const instead of var and let as call the variable
- module.export = component declared name
- what we find in module `console.log(module)`
- const result1 = require("./file-2.js") we import to to the file-2.js folder so we do it in our required file
- want to see the output in terminal just write `console.log(result1)`
- open the terminal in vs code and run `node file-1.js`
- want to change the folder just write the terminal `node ./file-2.js`
- you see the difference in exports when you add a function
